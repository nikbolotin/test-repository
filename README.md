# Test repository
Is created to test merges

# Rebase and merge strategy
Does it create new commit hashes?
Indeed the hash commits are different between the feature branch latest commit 
and the one that appears on the main branch

# Merge commit 
Test if after merge we are able to get a commit from which the merge commit was made
